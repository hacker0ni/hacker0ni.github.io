I'm a seasoned Security Architect with great interest in forensic analysis, web application firewalls, infrastructure security and more. These past few years I have gained hands-on experience in architecting scalable SIEM and threat detection solutions using only open-source tools. I currently work at Akamai. Everything shared in this blog are strictly my opinions and not my employer's. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and send a message if you need help or want to discuss anything related to cybersecurity.

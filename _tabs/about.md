I'm a cyber security engineer with great interest in disk and memory forensic analysis. I have hands-on experience in architecting reliable and scalable SIEM and threat detection solutions using open-source tools. I currently work at Akamai. Everything shared in this blog are strictly my opinions and not my employer's (duh). Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and send a message if you need help!
